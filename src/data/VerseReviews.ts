          "Pretty straightforward and no-nonsense, does what its supposed to do, minus superfluous stuff. The static lyrics are effortless, but the dynamic/live lyrics are a bit delayed, but they're still beta so cant bash the dev for it. The fonts are beautiful, the interface is lovely, and dark mode is an added bonus. Plus you can manually mute ads. A suggestion would be a widget window that could display the lyrics while im scrolling through instagram. Awesome app. 10/10",

          "Die App zeigt zuverlÃ¤ssig die Songtexte der Songs aus der Playlist von Spotify an. Hierzu muss sie separat geÃ¶ffnet werden. Es wird aber nicht geskrollt, so wie der Text gesungen wird. Bis jetzt hat die App bis auf einen Titel alle meine Songs angezeigt. Zu wÃ¼nschen wÃ¤re eine Funktion welche die Texte in andere Sprachen Ã¼bersetzt.",
